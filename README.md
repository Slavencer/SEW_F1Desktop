# Job Sew 2024 
## About the work 
It is my project done during my third year of the degree at Uniovi for the subject of Software and Web Standards. 
### description
It is a web page about Formula 1, with information about a specific randomly assigned driver and circuit. 
The driver is Zhou Guanyu, and the circuit is Shanghai.
The project attemps to follow the standards of the web design, so it is adaptable, and lacks id or class unless it was specified in the wordings.
### Technologies
It was developed using Xampp as a local server and visual studio code.
### What's not provided
I have not included neither the wordings of the project nor the reports of the usability tests nor the deployment.
Bear this in mind as there may lack context and some exercises were designed simply to teach the technologies, but the implementation would not make
a lot of sense in another context. (this is, being prohibited in using id or the fantasy game that is coded only in php)
## Disclaimer
This project was carried out while learning web design and standards, so it shows the inexperience I had in these technologies. 
This project is expected to aid any students in a similar situation, to aid in their research, but should not be strictly copied as this project lacks professionalism.
The mark of this project was 5.3, so expect the marks to be in such range.
Do not take seriously the commit messages as any message in them is purely sarcastic and stem from the lack of time and organization during the development.
